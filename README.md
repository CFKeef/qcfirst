# Coursor

A course management system for students and professors. Written by me :)

### Features

-Handles both students and teachers

-   Students are able to view courses enrolled, courses offered and enroll into new ones
-   Teachers are able to view courses they are teaching and create new courses

-All CRUD operations are supported

-Day/Night theme

-Stale while revalidate pattern

### Technology

On the front end:
-NextJS
-React
-Styled Components

On the backend:
NextJS allows you to skip having an express server so I did everything through its "backend" using next-connect


And for my database I used Postgresql


### Design

Heres the general look of the pages but they are subject to change as I bring it to development. Notes may be visible as well.

#### Form Pages (Login, Signup, recover)

#### Differences
- No calendar section and menu items differ
- Virtualization and Infinite scrolling is not on app
- Layout shift from nav on bottom to moved to top for mobile
- Search/Results is split up on main app but the mock up has them sharing the page
